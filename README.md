# Self organizing Neural Network Cluster
 for Processing

Tests on how self-organizing clustered neural networks could work!

### what it does
Data will be scanned for repeating patterns, and for every found pattern a new network will be added to the cluster!
every network in the cluster will be trained to only recognize the pattern it got assigned.

### TODO
- still needs an output layer that interprets the outputs of all the networks in the cluster!
- needs a better way to handle cluster-outputs
